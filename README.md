# User location tracking app

Developed a backend web application for managing and tracking user locations. The application provides RESTful APIs that allow users to register, update, and retrieve their geolocation data. Built with Spring Boot and integrated with MySQL for persistent data storage, the project demonstrates a basic REST API architecture connected to a relational database. Hibernate is used for object-relational mapping (ORM), ensuring seamless interaction between the Java domain model and the database.
